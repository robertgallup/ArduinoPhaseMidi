Arduino Code for Phase Midi Project

Code behind the Phase Midi Project as seen in the Vimeo video, https://vimeo.com/62961812, "Music for One Arduino"

Runs on an Arduino (I think ATMega168) with two potentiometers, a button, five LEDs,
a momentary contact pushbutton, and a MIDI out connected to serial out.
